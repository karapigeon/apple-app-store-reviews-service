# Notes

- My current machine is very lacking so using a GitHub Codespace to work on this.
- I configured the dev container to enable the Docker-in-Docker feature.
- I used [`npx create-next-app@latest`](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project#nextjs-pages-router) to create the React app. Front-end is not my main area of expertise so this was not an opinionated decision but the easy-DX starter.
- I used [`rustup`](https://rustup.rs/) to install Rust within the GitHub Codespace.
