This app has likely saved me money (of me missing a few dollars/cents trying to figure out this math on my own) and so many headaches splitting bills of large groups at restaurants that do not want to take the time to do separate checks. \n\nOver time, I have actually found it easier to just use this app rather than asking the server to do separate checks. In my experience with Tab, if you’re willing to do the work of figuring out who got what yourself, your servers get the order right, your food comes quicker (since they don’t have to spend a long time at the computer typing everything in carefully), and it makes the experience for the group better as a whole. \n\nA few feature suggestions:\n\nAppetizers: A conversation that tends to come up when deciding who got what is “well this person are more of this than this person.” Can you create a way to say “this person had 4 of 12 items from this” instead of splitting it 12 ways and tapping it four times? Technically the app does this, but it requires a bit of extra taps. \n\nAlcohol: Guests may feel it’s appropriate to tip more for elaborate cocktails than they would for a pizza. Servers also tip out the bartender. Is there a way to figure out how to skew tips up based on how much of the bill was alcohol? For example, 15% for the food, 20% for the alcohol.","author":"Rosentrotter","score":"5","timestamp":"2023-09-24T21:42:04-07:00","id":"Rosentrotter-2023-09-24T21:42:04-07:00"},{"content":"So so so cool!!!
